### How to Export Video with Transparent Background

Are you ready to take your videos and streams up a level?

Whether is 16 by 9 or 4 by 3, the space must be used economically. I've spent years streaming badly. What does that mean:

- bad audio quality
- poor lighting
- poor screen real estate management
  - small font is hard to read
  - no titles means viewers don't know what their watching

Example 1 of me doing it wrong:

![Example one of screen real estate used poorly by @awefulBrown during one of their streams. Text is hard to read and poorly placed.](https://res.cloudinary.com/devdash54321/image/upload/v1586921617/idnkhtw-blog/2020-04/alpha-channel-hard-to-read-text-poor-placement.png)

Example 2 of me doing it wrong:

![Example two of graphics and an alpha channel used poorly by @awefulBrown during one of their streams. There are too many items on the screen and the text is too small to read.](https://res.cloudinary.com/devdash54321/image/upload/v1586921617/idnkhtw-blog/2020-04/alpha-channel-too-much-to-see-small-text.png)

Today we're going to learn how to create video graphics that export an alpha channel. Exporting the alpha channel of a video will allow you to display the video over another graphic or video with both images/videos appearing on screen. We see examples of this on television all the time, especially in sports. In american football, you'll see the yellow line as the unoffical first down marker. The image below has a yellow line to mark the first down on the left side of the image, a red line to mark the line of scrimmage in the center of the image, and the information bar with the score, team names, game clock and other game information at the bottom of the image.

Other examples of exporting a graphic with an alpha channel are the overlay graphic that appears on the news shows we watch, including most of what you see the weatherperson pointing towards. The image below is from the Comedy Central show The Daily Show. The image in the upper left corner is exported with an alpha channel.

Example 1 of screen real estate done well on during a stream:

![Screenshot of gamers streaming a game with with alpha channel done well and clear view of the action.](https://res.cloudinary.com/devdash54321/image/upload/v1586923392/idnkhtw-blog/2020-04/alpha-channel-done-well-clear-view-of-the-action.png)

Example 2 of screen real estate done well on during a stream:

![Screenshot of gamers introduction to their stream. Showing the players, player avatars, score, team names, and sponsors.](https://res.cloudinary.com/devdash54321/image/upload/v1586923386/idnkhtw-blog/2020-04/alpha-channel-done-well-easy-to-read-text.png)

Adding a still image or a graphic overlay to a video is more common than adding a video overlay to another video. In a previous blog post we learned how to create a video with an alpha channel.

This will be quick. It's all about the export options you choose. This is one way to export a video with an alpha channel. There are many.

We're using [Davinci Resolve 16](http://bit.ly/3bVr0uM) by Blackmagic Design to produce videos. It's a free and dope. They make awesome hardware too. I use the ATEM Mini for my streams. It's overkill for what I do. I hope to grow my stream to take full advantage of its power.

We're assuming that Davinci Resolve 16 is installed and we have a video with an alpha channel ready to export. Click the `Deliver` button at the bottom right of the screen. It looks like a rocket blasting off :rocket: .
