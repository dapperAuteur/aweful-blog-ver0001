They Is My Family Member.

So, as a child, I called blckbon my niece. While [reading about blckbon’s art](https://blckbon.weebly.com/about.html), I saw that blckbon was referred to as they. Therefore, I infer that niece is no longer an appropriate identifier for blckbon. I must ask them what they prefer, if anything at all.

Technically, blckbon is my second cousin. Our parents are cousins. I called blckbon my niece because of the age difference, a generational difference. Their father calls me his nephew for the same reason. Though I'm his first cousin, once removed.

I’ll let you know what blckbon prefers. Maybe it’ll help you. If you find yourself in a similar situation.

Onward

(more to come.)
