Raise Your Prices
What Do You Know About The Supply/Demand Curve?

So my [family member](http://localhost:8000/idnkhtw/they-is-my-family-member) (link to blog post discussing what I should call my niece now that she uses they as the pronoun of choice. See if anyone else has had a similar experience. I’ll ask blckbon what their preference is.), blckbon, is a dope animator. [Receipts](https://twitter.com/blckbon/status/1128738440135135232), that's their hand drawn animation. They did that by hand. [I did this with a computer over a year ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT4Kg_ES8nQ) I’m proud of me and mine, including the struggle animation at the end of that link.

So I’m scrolling through fb a month or two back and see [post](http://voyagephoenix.com/interview/art-life-jadzia-hart/) about blckbon being interviewed for their artistry. I read it and followed the links. Checked out their social media and saw blckbon’s progression. There’s a post, asking for commissions. Price is crazy low, \$25.
MBA mode. Price is way too low. Hand drawn. I can see, if you’re at the circus, carnival, fair, pier, boardwalk, whatever.

Commissions Post:

$25 cool.
Not that those aren’t talented artists or that their work isn’t worth more than $25. It’s that they chose to create a commodity in my eyes. When you go there. You know what you’re going to get.

Any other artist. Any medium. Anything you create by hand, mind, or body. Price gotta start much higher.

Remember, i Do NOT Know How `this` works.
