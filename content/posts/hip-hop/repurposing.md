# Hip-Hop Jewels

A Hip-Hop Jewel is a word or phrase that one may use to help them make a decision when in a difficult situations.

Sometimes that word or phrase is entertaining on the surface. There's always depth to the words.

Hip-Hop Jewels are for the community and the culture. Hip-Hop Jewels are by the community and the culture. For generations what we created has been misrepresented by those not part of the community and/or those not putting the culture and community first. An example of this is the [Urban Dictionary post](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hip%20hop%20jewels). You may see a screenshot of the post below.

The Urban Dictionary site may be entertaining and it may add value for some. The intentions of those posting definitions may be good. It doesn't accurately define 'Hip-Hop Jewels' nor our words or phrases.

I'm not the Hip-Hop police. Tho' I don't want to stand by and watch as any part of the culture is repurposed.

I'm not looking to demonize Urban Dictionary. Not looking to start a boycott or any social campaign against them. I'm not asking them to change at all.

I'm creating a tool for me to share the value I've gained from Hip-Hop with others.

I hope you enjoy.
