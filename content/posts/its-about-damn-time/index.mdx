I respect the movement and wanted to help.

I don't know where or how I became aware of Arlan Hamilton. I do know that I've found myself retweeting or liking many of their microposts on Twitter. I didn't sign up when I first heard about the book, but I was moved to do so after checking out the class entitled [How to Raise Capital for Your Company From Scratch](https://arlanwashere.teachable.com/). Especially after I saw there was a discount for the class for those that participated in the book launch. I like, my mamma, am a sucker for deals. So, within a few hours, I broke bread with Arlan conglomerate. Purchasing the class for myself, the hardcover book for my mamma and the audiobook for myself. She's already started it and enjoying it. As of this writing I'm on chapter 13. I plan on writing about my take-aways from each chapter and sharig them. [You may find my takeaways from chapter 13 here](https://www.idonotknowhowthisworks.com/its-about-damn-time-chapter-13-takeaways).

Let me know if you'd like to talk about the book and share what you've gained from the experience.

Onward.
