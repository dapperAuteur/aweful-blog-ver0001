illustrating how they decide when to write about something. If they have questions about the topic, assume others do. Write about it.

If they don't have questions about the topic, assume others know as much as them or more. Don't write about it.

Hopefully, this manual (book, videos, blog, however you decide to consume it), isn't needed after 2020.

Step 1:

      - Choose a specific topic or tool
      - Learn as much as possible about it
      - Share what we learn
      - Help others
      - Tell anybody and everybody
